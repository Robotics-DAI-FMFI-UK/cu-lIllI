To compile on Linux, the following needs to be done:

 - suppose you have the educational IntelliJ Idea installed, then we
   add path to bin folder so that he maven can be found (then we do not
   need to install maven separately)

   for example by adding this line at the end of ~/.bashrc

    export PATH=/usr/local/jetbrains/idea-IU-243.26053.27/plugins/maven/lib/maven3/bin:$PATH

   we have also added to the same file the following lines for the installation of CoppeliaSim to find:

    export COPPELIASIM_ROOT=/usr/local/coppelia/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_9_0_rev6_Ubuntu24_04
    export PATH=$COPPELIASIM_ROOT:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$COPPELIASIM_ROOT:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=$COPPELIASIM_ROOT

   (close the terminal and open it again)

 Building the Java ZeroMQ Client:

 - edit the maven file pom.xml and replace
    both occurences of "${env.COPPELIASIM_ROOT_DIR}" with
    absolute path to where your CoppeliaSim is installed, for example
     /usr/local/coppelia/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_9_0_rev6_Ubuntu24_04/

 - several python packages are required, they are usually available
    as Ubuntu packages (recommended), or if you use some local environment, 
    they can be installed with pip. We list the ubuntu packages to be
    installed with 
      $ sudo apt install <package>

     python3-dataclasses-json
     python3-atomicwrites
     python3-lark
     python3-cbor
     fonts-font-awesome

     (we have also installed some other Ubuntu packages which are probably 
      not needed, but noting it here for reference:
        idle3, tk-dev, tcl-dev, tk python3-regex)

  - then just buiild the java client as explained in the instructions at
    
  - finally navigate to the CoppeliaSim's folder, e.g.
      $ cd /usr/local/coppelia/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_9_0_rev6_Ubuntu24_04
      $ cd programming/zmqRemoteApi/clients/java
    and run mvn:
      $ mvn package -D"GENERATE_INCLUDE_OBJECTS=sim,simIK"
    (as explained at https://manual.coppeliarobotics.com/en/zmqRemoteApiOverview.htm)

  - we have also set the PYTHONPATH as follows:
      export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/coppelia/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_9_0_rev6_Ubuntu24_04/python:$PYTHONPATH
    but that's probably not needed


  - now to compile this IntelliJ project, one has to add these libraries into the project
     - the zmQ java remote API client: coppeliaSim-zmqRemoteApi-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT
         (for example /usr/local/coppelia/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_9_0_rev6_Ubuntu24_04/programming/zmqRemoteApi/clients/java/target/coppeliaSim-zmqRemoteApi-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT )
     - cbor-0.9, probably found at
         /home/user/.m2/repository/co/nstant/in/cbor/0.9/cbor-0.9.jar
     - jeromq-0.5.2, probably found at
         /home/user/.m2/repository/org/zeromq/jeromq/0.5.2/jermoq-0.5.2.jar

  - to run, make sure you have a full openJDK installed, not only the openjdk-ver-jdk-headless, which
    does not contain the graphical libraries
