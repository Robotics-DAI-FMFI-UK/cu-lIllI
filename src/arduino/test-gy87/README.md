This example prints the roll-pitch-yaw angles computed
inside of the gy-87 (based on MPU6050) IMU device from
the 6-degrees of freedom accelerometer/gyroscope.

It is taken from Jeff Rowberg's git repository
https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
without any modifications.

Only the required files are copied here. 
Also, dependences on external world are always
a trouble, so we keep our copy laying here.
