This project builds on accel_movement, movement_sequence, and simple_servo_controller
by providing a communication interface with another computer over serial line
(for example a PC, but it could be anything else)

It is based on project in ../test_accel_servo

and it adds movement_sequence_parser, which is able to parse 
the movement_sequence from its binary form represented as
an array of bytes

it also adds comm, which can send and receive packets over
serial line with headers (including header mark, packet type, packet length)
and CRC control byte

finally, it adds lilli_comm_dispatcher  that can be plugged with comm
and defines and implements behavior of simple packet types, such as

 IMMEDIATE_COMMAND  - that moves a specified servo from a position
                        to another position immediately (with acceleration)
 LOAD_SEQUENCE      - that loads a sequence from its binary representation
                        arriving on a serial line
 START_SEQUENCE     - to start plaing a stored sequence at a specified time
 STOP_SEQUENCE      - to stop playing the current sequence
 RESET_TIME_ORIGIN  - to reset time origin to which all sequence starts are relative
 PAUSE_SEQUENCE / RESUME_SEQUENCE  - to pause and resume currently played sequence


a test provided test_lilli_comm  initialized the above for three servos, 
plugs it together with simple_servo_controller from previous project
and stays idle, allowing for the communication with the peer to take place.

You can use a java program in ../../java/test_lilli_comm to test this program
from PC



Note:

This project is sharing files of project ../test_accel_servo
those files are linked here with relative symbolic links.

If you run into problems with symlinks on Windows, try this:

git config --show-scope --show-origin core.symlinks 

Most likely a "local" configuration is overriding the "global" 
or "system" setting. 

git config --unset core.symlinks 

will clear a "local" setting allowing a higher level setting to take effect,
which you can control with

git config --global core.symlinks true
