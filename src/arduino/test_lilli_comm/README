This project is sharing files of project ../test_accel_servo
those files are linked here with relative symbolic links.

If you run into problems with symlinks on Windows, try this:

git config --show-scope --show-origin core.symlinks 

Most likely a "local" configuration is overriding the "global" 
or "system" setting. 

git config --unset core.symlinks 

will clear a "local" setting allowing a higher level setting to take effect,
which you can control with

git config --global core.symlinks true
