This is a PC-side of a test of Teensy (arduino) modules for 
accellerated movements of servos that can be found in 
../../arduino/test_lilli_movement  - for simple servos connected directly to Teensy
../../arduino/test_lilli_i2c_movement - for servos connected through Adafruit PWM Servo driver

It sends some testing immediate commands and a sequence of servo movements.
It works with both, but switch between the two by triggering the simple_servo_test flag in TestLilliSerialPort,
which is the main class of the test.

The modules LilliSerialPort together with LilliDispatcher, ServoInstruction, and PacketListener
can be used independent of the test in other projects.


Please download jSerialComm from https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/
We used version 2.11

compile with:

javac -cp .;jSerialComm-2.11.0.jar *.java

run with:

java -cp .;jSerialComm-2.11.0.jar TestLilliSerialPort <serial_port_number>

This is the PC side for the test in ../arduino/test_lilli_comm

Developed for and tested on Teensy 4.1.
